		<h4>The EPA classifies sources of air pollution large enough to require a permit into four categories.</h4>
		<p><span class="highlight-1">Megasites</span> are the most severe of the EPA classifications. 
			These are considered "extremely large, complex facilities" that emit air pollutants at a Major Source scale.</p>

		<p><span class="highlight-2">Major Sources</span> are classified as such when they emit more than 10 tons per year 
			of a Hazardous Air Pollutant (HAP)<sup>*</sup>, more than 25 tons per year of a combination of HAPs, or more than 
			100 tons of all air pollutants. </p>

		<p><span class="highlight-3">Synthetic Minor Sources</span> have the capacity to pollute like a Major Source, 
			but the company has agreed to limit emissions. If the facility were to violate its permit 
			and emit more than allowed, it could pollute as much as a Major Source.</p>

		<p><span class="highlight-4">True Minor Sources</span> do not have the capacity to pollute like a Major Source,
		but emit enough air pollution to require a permit.</p>

	<h4>About the project</h4>

	<p>Thousands of sources of air pollution operate in Michigan under a permit.
	EGLE's Air Quality Division routinely inspects, reviews emission data and 
	responds to complaints about these facilities. Sometimes they issue violation
	notices if a company has violated one of the terms of its permit.</p>

	<p>It could be that the source has emitted more air pollution than is allowed, 
	or failed to track its emissions, maintain equipment or acquire a permit in the first place.</p>

	<p>These violations are public records, but they are not easy to find as they live in a <a class="article" href="https://www.egle.state.mi.us/aps/downloads/SRN/" target="_blank">system of folders</a>
		in EGLE's database. Planet Detroit's Air Permit Violation Dashboard is an attempt 
		to make this information more accessible.</p>
		
		<p>The map and recent violations update on a daily basis and show sources of air pollution that have violated
		their permits since 2018. You can find more information about these facilities 
		and others by browsing the <a class="article" href="https://www.tinyurl.com/egle-air-documents" target="_blank">full dataset</a>  
		for inspection reports, enforcement notices, older violations and more.	<em>Pro Tip: Filter for a specific facility by using its "SRN" or State Registration Number located
		at the top right of their profile on the map.</em>
	 </p>
